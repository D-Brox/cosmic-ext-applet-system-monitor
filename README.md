- [x] Network I/O
- [x] Disk I/O
- [x] GPU (usage and VRAM)
- [ ] Thermal sensors

## Special Thanks

- [paradoxxxzero](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero) for their [GNOME Shell system monitor extension](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet), the inspiration for this applet
- [edfloreshz](https://github.com/edfloreshz) for the [template for COSMIC applets](https://github.com/edfloreshz/cosmic-applet-template), which taught me the logic behind an applet
- [aschiavon91](https://github.com/aschiavon91) for their initial work at a [system status applet](https://github.com/aschiavon91/cosmic-applet-sys-status/), which was used as a reference implementation

## Known wgpu issue

There are currently some rendering issues with the `wgpu` libcosmic features in some older hybrid gpus.
If you are affected by this, you can build and install it with this feature disabled, however this may lead to other problems:

```sh
just build-no-wgpu

# Debin based
command -v cargo-deb || cargo install cargo-deb
cargo deb
sudo just install-deb

# RPM based
strip -s target/release/cosmic-ext-applet-system-monitor
cargo generate-rpm
sudo just install-rpm

# Other distros
sudo just install
```
